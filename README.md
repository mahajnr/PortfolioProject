# PortfolioProject
this repository contains portfolio projects that i did using SQL server,
the task undertaken includes DML (data manipulation language), which includes selection query of the tables, joining of the tables, which are covid deaths and covid vaccination, also performed aggregate function using the group by clause, and order by to arrange the data in asc and desc order in other to get a better view of the data
where clause was also used to filter the data when need be.
DDL (data definition language) where I created tables, inserted into them, drop them and also created views in other to visualize in the future.
